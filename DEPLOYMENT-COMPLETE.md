# ‚úÖ Deployment Setup Complete!

## What's Been Done

1. ‚úÖ **Configured Vite** for GitHub Pages with correct base path
2. ‚úÖ **Created GitHub Actions workflow** for automatic build and deployment
3. ‚úÖ **Added root index.html** that redirects to the English homepage
4. ‚úÖ **Built the production site** with optimized images and assets
5. ‚úÖ **Pushed all changes** to GitHub

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ONE FINAL STEP REQUIRED

You need to enable GitHub Actions in your repository settings:

### Go Here Now:
**https://github.com/Deckenmarc/fligthservice365/settings/pages**

### Change This Setting:
Under **"Build and deployment"** section:
- **Source**: Change from "Deploy from a branch" to **"GitHub Actions"**

That's it! Just change that one dropdown.

## What Happens Next

1. GitHub Actions will automatically run (takes 2-3 minutes)
2. Your site will be built with Vite
3. Images and assets will be optimized
4. Everything will be deployed to GitHub Pages

## Your Site URLs

After deployment completes:

- **Main URL**: https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/
  - This will automatically redirect to the English homepage

- **English Homepage**: https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/src/pages/en/index.html
- **German Homepage**: https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/src/pages/de/index.html

## Check Deployment Progress

Watch the build here:
**https://github.com/Deckenmarc/fligthservice365/actions**

You'll see "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running. Wait for the green checkmark ‚úì

## What's Fixed

### Before (Broken):
- ‚ùå 404 errors
- ‚ùå Images not loading
- ‚ùå Navigation not working
- ‚ùå Raw source files served

### After (Working):
- ‚úÖ Root URL redirects to homepage
- ‚úÖ All images load correctly
- ‚úÖ Navigation works on every page
- ‚úÖ Built and optimized files served
- ‚úÖ Automatic deployment on every push

## Future Updates

From now on:
1. Make changes to your code
2. Push to `main` branch
3. GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys
4. Site updates in 2-3 minutes

No manual deployment needed!

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see 404:
1. Make sure you enabled "GitHub Actions" as the source
2. Wait for the workflow to complete (check Actions tab)
3. Clear your browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R)

### If images don't load:
1. Check that the workflow completed successfully
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check browser console for errors

### If workflow fails:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click on the failed workflow
3. Check the error message
4. Let me know and I'll help fix it

## Summary

Everything is configured and ready. Just enable GitHub Actions in the repository settings and your site will be live in minutes! üöÄ
