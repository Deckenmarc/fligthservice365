# GitHub Pages Final Setup - Action Required

## What Was Done

1. ✅ Configured Vite with correct base path for GitHub Pages
2. ✅ Built the production site
3. ✅ Created GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
4. ✅ Pushed all changes to GitHub

## What You Need to Do

### Enable GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions

You need to configure GitHub Pages to use GitHub Actions as the source:

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/Deckenmarc/fligthservice365

2. Click on **Settings** (top menu)

3. In the left sidebar, click **Pages**

4. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - **Source**: Select **GitHub Actions** (not "Deploy from a branch")
   
5. Click **Save**

That's it! The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- Build your site with Vite
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Run on every push to main branch

## After Setup

Once you've enabled GitHub Actions as the source:

1. The workflow will run automatically (check the **Actions** tab)
2. Wait 2-3 minutes for the build and deployment
3. Your site will be live at: **https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/**

## New Site URLs

After deployment, your pages will be at:

- **Homepage (EN)**: https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/src/pages/en/index.html
- **Homepage (DE)**: https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/src/pages/de/index.html
- **Fleet**: https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/src/pages/en/fleet.html
- **Team**: https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/src/pages/en/team.html
- **Contact**: https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/src/pages/en/contact.html

## Why This Approach?

The previous approach wasn't working because:
1. GitHub Pages was serving raw source files, not the built files
2. Vite needs to build the site to process images and paths correctly
3. The build process optimizes images and bundles assets
4. GitHub Actions automates this build process on every push

## Verification

After enabling GitHub Actions:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see a workflow run called "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
3. Wait for it to complete (green checkmark)
4. Visit the site URL and verify:
   - ✅ Images load
   - ✅ Navigation works on all pages
   - ✅ CSS styles apply
   - ✅ Language switcher works

## Troubleshooting

If the workflow fails:
- Check the Actions tab for error messages
- Make sure GitHub Pages is set to "GitHub Actions" source
- Verify the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

If images still don't load:
- Clear your browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
- Check the browser console for 404 errors
- Verify the base path in `vite.config.js` matches your repo name

## Future Updates

From now on, any changes you push to the `main` branch will automatically:
1. Trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
2. Build the site with Vite
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
4. Be live in 2-3 minutes

No manual deployment needed!
