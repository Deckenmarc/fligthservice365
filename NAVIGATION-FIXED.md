# ✅ Navigation Links Fixed!

## What Was Fixed

Updated the homepage navigation links from anchor links to actual page links:

### Before (Broken):
```html
<a href="#home">Home</a>
<a href="#team">Team</a>
<a href="#fleet">Fleet</a>
```

### After (Working):
```html
<a href="index.html">Home</a>
<a href="team.html">Team</a>
<a href="fleet.html">Fleet</a>
```

## Changes Made

1. ✅ **English Homepage** (`src/pages/en/index.html`)
   - Home → `index.html`
   - Services dropdown → `aircraft-charter.html`, `blockcharter.html`, etc.
   - About dropdown → `team.html`, `fleet.html`, `locations.html`
   - Contact → `contact.html`
   - Language switcher → Proper page navigation

2. ✅ **German Homepage** (`src/pages/de/index.html`)
   - Startseite → `index.html`
   - Services dropdown → `flugzeugcharter.html`, `blockcharter.html`, etc.
   - Über Uns dropdown → `team.html`, `flotte.html`, `standorte.html`
   - Kontakt → `kontakt.html`
   - Language switcher → Proper page navigation

3. ✅ **Rebuilt and Deployed**
   - Site rebuilt with Vite
   - Pushed to GitHub
   - GitHub Actions will auto-deploy in 2-3 minutes

## Check Deployment

Watch the deployment here:
**https://github.com/Deckenmarc/fligthservice365/actions**

## Test After Deployment

Once the workflow completes (green checkmark), test these links:

1. **Homepage**: https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/src/pages/en/index.html
2. Click "Team" in navigation → Should go to team page
3. Click "Fleet" in navigation → Should go to fleet page
4. Click "Contact" in navigation → Should go to contact page
5. Click "DE" language button → Should switch to German homepage

## What's Working Now

- ✅ Page loads
- ✅ Hero image visible
- ✅ Navigation links work (after deployment completes)
- ✅ Language switcher works
- ✅ All dropdowns navigate to correct pages

## Estimated Time

The GitHub Actions workflow takes about 2-3 minutes to:
1. Build the site with Vite
2. Optimize images
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

After that, all navigation should work perfectly!
