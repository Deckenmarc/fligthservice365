# ‚úÖ Root Index.html Fixed!

## The Problem

The root URL `https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/` was showing 404 because:
1. Vite was building index.html to `dist/public/index.html`
2. GitHub Pages needs it at `dist/index.html` (root of dist folder)
3. The file wasn't being copied to the correct location

## The Solution

Updated the GitHub Actions workflow to:
1. Build the site with Vite
2. **Copy `dist/public/index.html` to `dist/index.html`**
3. Add `.nojekyll` file to prevent Jekyll processing
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

## What Was Changed

### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
Added a new step after build:
```yaml
- name: Copy root files
  run: |
    cp dist/public/index.html dist/index.html
    touch dist/.nojekyll
```

### `public/.nojekyll`
Created an empty `.nojekyll` file to tell GitHub Pages not to process files with Jekyll.

## Timeline

1. ‚úÖ Changes committed and pushed
2. ‚è≥ GitHub Actions is running now (takes 2-3 minutes)
3. ‚è≥ Wait for green checkmark in Actions tab
4. ‚úÖ Root URL will work!

## Check Progress

Watch the deployment here:
**https://github.com/Deckenmarc/fligthservice365/actions**

## After Deployment

Once the workflow completes (green checkmark ‚úì), test:

1. **Root URL**: https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/
   - Should show loading spinner
   - Should automatically redirect to English homepage

2. **Direct URL**: https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/src/pages/en/index.html
   - Should work as before

## What the Root Index Does

When you visit `https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/`:
1. Loads the redirect page with Flight Service 365 branding
2. Shows a loading spinner
3. Automatically redirects to `/src/pages/en/index.html`
4. Uses both meta refresh and JavaScript for compatibility

## Estimated Time

**2-3 minutes** for GitHub Actions to:
- Build the site
- Copy index.html to root
- Deploy to GitHub Pages

After that, the root URL will work perfectly!

## Summary

- ‚úÖ Identified the issue (index.html in wrong location)
- ‚úÖ Updated workflow to copy file to correct location
- ‚úÖ Added .nojekyll file
- ‚úÖ Committed and pushed
- ‚è≥ Waiting for deployment (2-3 minutes)
- üéØ Root URL will work after deployment completes
