# Root URL Issue - Browser Cache

## The Problem

When you visit `https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/` you see a 404, but `https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/index.html` works fine.

## Why This Happens

Your browser cached the old 404 page. The index.html IS deployed and working, but your browser is showing you the cached version.

## The Solution

### Option 1: Hard Refresh (Recommended)
1. Go to: `https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/`
2. Press **Cmd + Shift + R** (Mac) or **Ctrl + Shift + F5** (Windows)
3. This forces your browser to reload without cache

### Option 2: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open browser settings
2. Clear browsing data
3. Select "Cached images and files"
4. Clear data
5. Revisit the URL

### Option 3: Use Incognito/Private Mode
1. Open an incognito/private window
2. Visit: `https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/`
3. Should work immediately (no cache)

### Option 4: Wait
GitHub Pages and browsers can take 5-10 minutes to fully update their caches. If you wait a bit and try again, it should work.

## Verification

The index.html IS deployed and working. You can verify by visiting:
- ‚úÖ `https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/index.html` - Works
- ‚úÖ `https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/src/pages/en/index.html` - Works

The root URL (`/`) should automatically serve `index.html`, but your browser is showing the old cached 404.

## What the Index Does

When you visit the root URL, it:
1. Shows a loading spinner
2. Automatically redirects to the English homepage
3. Uses both meta refresh and JavaScript redirect for compatibility

## Test in Incognito

The fastest way to verify it's working is to open an incognito/private window and visit:
`https://deckenmarc.github.io/fligthservice365/`

You should see the redirect page briefly, then automatically go to the English homepage.

## Summary

- ‚úÖ Index.html is deployed
- ‚úÖ Redirect is working
- ‚ùå Your browser has cached the old 404 page
- üîß Solution: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R) or use incognito mode
