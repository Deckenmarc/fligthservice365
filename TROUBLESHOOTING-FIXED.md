# 🔧 Issues Fixed - Flight Service 365

## ❌ Problems You Experienced

1. **No images showing**

## ✅ Root Cause

You were opening files directly (file:// protocol) instead of using a web server (http:// protocol).

### Why This Matters

|--------|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| **file://** (Direct) | ❌ Broken | ❌ Broken | ❌ Broken | Nothing works |
| **http://** (Server) | ✅ Works | ✅ Works | ✅ Works | Everything works |

## 📍 Correct URLs

Always use these URLs (with http://):

### English Pages
- Homepage: http://localhost:8000/en/index.html
- Fleet: http://localhost:8000/en/fleet.html
- Aircraft Charter: http://localhost:8000/en/aircraft-charter.html
- Team: http://localhost:8000/en/team.html
- Contact: http://localhost:8000/en/contact.html

### German Pages
- Homepage: http://localhost:8000/de/index.html
- Flotte: http://localhost:8000/de/flotte.html
- Flugzeugcharter: http://localhost:8000/de/flugzeugcharter.html
- Team: http://localhost:8000/de/team.html
- Kontakt: http://localhost:8000/de/kontakt.html

## ⚠️ Don't Use These

❌ **WRONG:** file:///Users/you/project/src/pages/en/index.html  
✅ **RIGHT:** http://localhost:8000/en/index.html

## 🔄 If Server Stops

If the server stops or you close the terminal:

**Restart it:**
```bash
./START-HERE.sh
```

**Or manually:**
```bash
cd src/pages
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open: http://localhost:8000/en/index.html

## 🐛 Still Having Issues?

### Images Still Not Loading?
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Look for 404 errors
3. Verify images exist:
   ```bash
   ls src/assets/images/
   ```

### Links Still Not Working?
1. Make sure you're using http://localhost:8000
2. Not file:///
3. Check browser address bar

### German Page Still English?
1. Make sure you're at: http://localhost:8000/de/index.html
2. Not: http://localhost:8000/en/index.html
3. Check the URL carefully

### Server Not Starting?
1. Port 8000 might be in use
2. Try different port:
   ```bash
   cd src/pages
   python3 -m http.server 8001
   ```
3. Then use: http://localhost:8001/en/index.html
