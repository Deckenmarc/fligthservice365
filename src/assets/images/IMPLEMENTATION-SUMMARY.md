   - Team: `placeholder-team-member.svg`
   - Backgrounds: `placeholder-hero-home.svg`
   - Routes: `placeholder-route.svg`
   - Services: `placeholder-service-banner.svg`

3. **Documentation Created**
   - **`README.md`**: Comprehensive documentation of all required images
     - Specifications for each image type
     - Dimensions and format requirements
     - Naming conventions
     - Optimization guidelines
     - Accessibility requirements

   - Comprehensive examples for different use cases
   - Guidelines for when to use `<picture>` vs `<img>`
   - Alt text best practices
   - Srcset and sizes attribute examples

3. **JavaScript Utility Created**
   - `src/scripts/responsive-images.js`
   - Helper functions for creating responsive images dynamically
   - Validation functions for alt text and dimensions
   - Auto-initialization for lazy loading
   - Development mode warnings for missing attributes

4. **Implementation Guide Created**
   - `src/assets/images/IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`
   - Practical examples for all image types
   - Alt text patterns and examples
   - Testing checklist

   - Browser support information

### Key Features Implemented

**Responsive Images:**
- Multiple sizes: 320w, 768w, 1024w, 1920w
- WebP format with JPEG/PNG fallback
- Appropriate `sizes` attribute for each use case
- Lazy loading for images below the fold

**Accessibility:**
- Descriptive alt text for all meaningful images
- Empty alt (`alt=""`) for decorative images
- `aria-hidden="true"` for decorative icons
- Width and height attributes to prevent layout shift

**Performance:**
- Lazy loading reduces initial page load
- WebP format provides 25-35% better compression
- Proper dimensions prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Progressive JPEGs for better perceived performance

### Files Created
- `src/components/responsive-image-template.html`
- `src/scripts/responsive-images.js`
- `src/assets/images/IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`

### Files Modified
- `src/components/header.html`
- `src/components/footer.html`
- `src/components/service-card.html`
- `src/components/team-member-card.html`
- `src/components/aircraft-card.html`

## Subtask 16.3: Set Up Image Optimization in Build Process ✅

### What Was Done

1. **Vite Configuration Enhanced**
   - Updated `vite.config.js` with comprehensive image optimization
   - Added detailed comments explaining each optimization setting
   - Configured optimal quality settings for each format

   **Optimization Settings:**
   - JPEG: 85% quality, progressive format (mozjpeg)
   - PNG: 80-90% quality, lossless + lossy optimization (optipng + pngquant)
   - WebP: 85% quality, automatic generation
   - SVG: Optimized while preserving viewBox and accessibility attributes
   - GIF: Maximum optimization level

2. **Build Process Documentation**
   - `IMAGE-OPTIMIZATION.md` - Complete guide to the build process
   - Explains how each format is optimized
   - Documents expected file size reductions
   - Provides troubleshooting guidance
   - Includes performance metrics and targets

3. **Image Generation Script**
   - `scripts/generate-responsive-images.js`
   - Automates creation of responsive image sizes
   - Generates both original format and WebP versions
   - Provides HTML usage examples
   - Includes help documentation

4. **Scripts Documentation**
   - `scripts/README.md`
   - Documents all available build scripts
   - Provides usage examples
   - Lists dependencies

### Build Process Flow

**Development Mode (`npm run dev`):**
- Images served as-is for fast development
- No optimization applied

**Production Build (`npm run build`):**
1. All images in `src/assets/images/` are processed
2. JPEG images optimized to 85% quality (progressive)
3. PNG images optimized with lossless + lossy compression
4. WebP versions automatically generated
5. SVG images optimized (metadata removed, viewBox preserved)
6. Optimized images output to `dist/assets/images/`

### Expected Performance Improvements

- **JPEG**: 20-40% smaller file size
- **PNG**: 40-70% smaller file size
- **WebP**: 25-35% smaller than equivalent JPEG
- **SVG**: 10-30% smaller file size

### Files Created
- `IMAGE-OPTIMIZATION.md`
- `scripts/generate-responsive-images.js`
- `scripts/README.md`

### Files Modified
- `vite.config.js` - Enhanced image optimization configuration
- `package.json` - Added `generate-images` script
