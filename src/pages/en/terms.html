          <h2>1. Scope of Application</h2>
          <p>
            These Terms and Conditions apply to all contracts between Flight Service 365 (hereinafter referred to 
            as "Provider") and its customers for the provision of aviation services, including aircraft charter, 
            flight training, hour-building, and trial flights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deviating, conflicting, or supplementary general terms and conditions of the customer shall only become 
            part of the contract if and to the extent that the Provider has expressly agreed to their validity in 
            writing.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Contract Formation</h2>
          <p>
            The presentation of services on our website does not constitute a legally binding offer, but rather a 
            non-binding invitation to place an order.
          </p>
          <p>
            By submitting a booking request via our contact form, email, or telephone, the customer makes a binding 
            offer to conclude a contract. The Provider may accept this offer within 7 days by sending an order 
            confirmation via email or by providing the service.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Prices and Payment Terms</h2>

            In case of payment default, the Provider is entitled to charge default interest at a rate of 5 
            percentage points above the base rate. The assertion of higher default damages remains reserved.
          </p>

          </p>

          <h3>5.2 Cancellation by Provider</h3>
          <p>
            The Provider reserves the right to cancel a booking for good cause, particularly in case of:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Adverse weather conditions that do not allow safe flight operations</li>
            <li>Technical problems with the aircraft</li>
            <li>Official orders or force majeure</li>
            <li>Illness or unavailability of pilot without available replacement</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In such cases, the customer will be informed immediately and will receive the option of free rebooking 
            or full refund of payments already made. Further claims for damages are excluded unless there is 
            intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Service Provision</h2>
          
          <h3>6.1 Flight Times</h3>
          <p>
            All stated flight times are approximate and may change due to weather conditions, air traffic control, 
            or other operational reasons. The Provider endeavors to minimize delays but assumes no liability for 
            delays.
          </p>

          <h3>6.2 Safety Regulations</h3>
          <p>
            All flights are subject to applicable aviation regulations and safety requirements. The pilot has sole 
            decision-making authority regarding the execution of a flight. Customers are obliged to follow the 
            instructions of the pilot and crew.
          </p>

          <h3>6.3 Weight Restrictions</h3>
          <p>
            Weight restrictions apply to all flights according to the technical specifications of the respective 
            aircraft. Passengers are obliged to truthfully state their weight when booking. If permissible weight 
            limits are exceeded, the Provider reserves the right to refuse carriage or charge for additional 
            flights.
          </p>

          <h2>7. Liability</h2>
          
          <h3>7.1 Limitation of Liability</h3>
          <p>
            The Provider is liable without limitation for damages resulting from injury to life, body, or health 
            based on an intentional or negligent breach of duty by the Provider or a legal representative or 
            vicarious agent of the Provider.
          </p>
          <p>
            For other damages, the Provider is only liable in case of breach of an essential contractual obligation, 
            the fulfillment of which enables the proper execution of the contract in the first place and on whose 
            compliance the customer may regularly rely (cardinal obligation), as well as in case of gross negligence 
            and intent of the Provider, its legal representatives, or vicarious agents.
          </p>

          <h3>7.2 Insurance</h3>
          <p>
            All aircraft are insured in accordance with legal requirements. The insurance covers liability damages 
            to third parties and passengers. No liability is assumed for personal belongings of passengers. 
            Customers are recommended to take out their own travel insurance.
          </p>

          <h2>8. Warranty</h2>
          <p>
            The Provider warrants the provision of agreed services in professional quality and in compliance with 
            all applicable aviation regulations. Defects must be reported in writing immediately upon discovery.
          </p>
          <p>
            In case of justified defect complaints, the customer is initially entitled to subsequent performance. 
            If subsequent performance fails, the customer may, at their choice, demand a reduction or withdraw from 
            the contract.
          </p>

          <h2>9. Data Protection</h2>
          <p>
            The Provider processes personal data of the customer for contract processing and in accordance with the 
            provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Further information can be found in our 
            <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
          </p>

          <h2>10. Dispute Resolution</h2>
          
          <h3>10.1 Complaints</h3>
          <p>
            Complaints should be addressed in writing to:
          </p>

            Email: contact@flightservice365.com

          <p>
            We endeavor to process and respond to all complaints within 14 days.
          </p>

          <h3>10.2 Alternative Dispute Resolution</h3>
          <p>
            The Provider is not obliged and not willing to participate in a dispute resolution procedure before a 
            consumer arbitration board.
          </p>

          <h2>11. Final Provisions</h2>
          
          <h3>11.1 Applicable Law</h3>
          <p>
            The law of the Federal Republic of Germany shall apply to all legal relationships between the Provider 
            and the customer, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. For 
            consumers, this choice of law only applies insofar as the protection granted by mandatory provisions 
            of the law of the state in which the consumer has their habitual residence is not withdrawn.
          </p>

          <h3>11.2 Place of Jurisdiction</h3>
          <p>
            If the customer is a merchant, legal entity under public law, or special fund under public law, the 
            exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this contract is the Provider's place of 
            business. The same applies if the customer does not have a general place of jurisdiction in Germany or 
            if their residence or habitual abode is not known at the time the action is filed.
          </p>

          <h3>11.3 Severability Clause</h3>
          <p>
            Should individual provisions of these Terms and Conditions be or become invalid, the validity of the 
            remaining provisions shall remain unaffected. The invalid provision shall be replaced by a valid 
            provision that comes closest to the economic purpose of the invalid provision.
          </p>
